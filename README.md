# It is a Multimodal time series prediction project for Shenzheng city in China.

The work was down by mix of Chinese and English, because it is a English project but using Chinese data.

In the code file, file Descriptive Statistics, 3,4,5,6, and 9 are down on local laptop and others are down through Google Colab.

I lost my origianl 512 features I extract from the satellite image, now, the 512 feature in file feature.csv in data was extracted again by me using the same method, but there might be a slight difference from original one, because it was extracted using the pre-trained RESNET-18(a kind of convolutional neural network).
